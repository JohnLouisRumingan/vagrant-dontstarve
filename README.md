[Certification](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/vagrant-azure#certificate-generation) is copied from [vagrant-azure](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/vagrant-azure) repository.

We will use ```makecert.exe``` distributed as part of the in the Windows 7 SDK. The following commands will create the required certificates and insert them into the current userâ€™s personal store.

*```makecert.exe -r -pe -a sha1 -n "CN=My Azure Management Certificate" -ss My -sr CurrentUser -len 2048 -sky exchange -sp "Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider" -sy 24```

*```makecert.exe -r -pe -a sha1 -n "CN=My Azure SSL Certificate" -ss My -sr CurrentUser -len 2048 -sky exchange -sp "Microsoft Enhanced RSA and AES Cryptographic Provider" -sy 24```

If you generated those two certificates, now you have to export them to your disk and import into Azure Portal.
